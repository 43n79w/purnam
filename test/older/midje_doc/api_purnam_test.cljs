"`init` is a macro that has to be placed at the top of every test file. It is necessary so that the right checkers can be set up."

(init) ;; ALWAYS REQUIRED BEFORE ANY TESTS

[[:section {:title "describe"}]]

"`describe` is the top-level form for testing. Its usage is in combination with the setup clause `it` and the checkers `is` and `is-not`. `:globals` sets up bindings for variables that can be manipulated but cannot be rebounded. `:vars` are allowed to be rebounded."
