**purnum** provides javascript friendly language constructs for clojurescript. Essentially, it gives the developer the *option* for writing clojurescript code mirroring raw javascript as well as providing a workflow for Test Driven Developement. The library was created with clojurescript, javascript *and* clojure developers in mind:

- If you are a clojurescript developer and wish to work with existing javascript libraries using more succinct code, then `purnam` was written for you.

- If you are a javascript developer and wish to be introduced to the world of parens, namespaces and macros, writing clojurescript with `purnam` should not look too different and may even be 'friendlier' than writing raw javascript.

- If you are a clojure developer and wish to start learning exisiting javascript frameworks, then `purnam` will make your life much easier as it allows the clojurescript semantics to look virtually identical to online javascript tutorials.
